# Active Record Associations Conclusion

In this module, we've discussed the advantages of using Active Record and using
association macros. Active Record automates the ORM setup significantly in a
simpler format.

We also discussed:

- The features of Rake
- Common methods accessible through Active Record associations
- How to use association macros

With this understanding of Active Record, persisting data
becomes easier. We can now set up and work with models and build associations
between them by leveraging methods such as `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and
`has_many :through`. We're well on our way to being able to build fully
functioning apps end-to-end.
